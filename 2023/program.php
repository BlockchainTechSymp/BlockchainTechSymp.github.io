            <p><b>Abstract:</b> The popularity and growth of blockchain and crypto has many observers scratching their heads. For example, how does something like bitcoin grow in value and users with no central authority, marketing, or board of directors? Dogecoin may help answer this question. Blockchain community advocates maligned it since its inception in 2013 as the first meme coin. Its creators intended it to convey the fun of meme culture and to largely be a joke. It stuck around in the shallows of the coingecko rankings while many of its early stage peers failed or turned into zombie projects.Something changed in 2021 and it rocketed into the top 10 among with the most popular of coins and projects, such as bitcoin. This talk explores how memes are more than ephemeral content. They are communicative acts of sharing and negotiating social values and cultural norms. Dogecoin embodies meme culture and how value is driven by digital networks and communities in crypto rather than corporations.</p>

            <p><b>Abstract:</b> The untrusted centralized nature of energy markets and EV charging infrastructures result in several privacy and security threats to EV user’s private information. These security and privacy threats include targeted advertisements, privacy leakage, selling data to third parties, etc. In this work, we propose BlockEV, a blockchain-based efficient CS selection protocol for EVs to ensure the security and privacy of the EV users, availability of the reserved time slots at CSs, high Quality of Service (QoS) and enhanced EV user comfort. First, a blockchain-based framework is introduced to implement secure charging services and trusted reservation for EVs with the execution of smart contract. Second, we focus on the efficient CS selection and propose a mechanism for EVs to select the CS locally without sharing private information to CS, while fulfilling their service requirements.</p>

            <p><b>Abstract:</b> Blockchains are decentralized; are they genuinely? We analyze blockchain decentralization's often overlooked but quantifiable dimension: geospatial distribution of transaction processing. Blockchains bring with them the potential for geospatially distributed transaction processing. They enable validators from geospatially distant locations to partake in consensus protocols; we refer to them as minority validators. Based on our observations, in practice, most validators are often geographically concentrated in proximity. Furthermore, we observed that minority validators tend not to meet the performance requirements, often misidentified as crash failures. Consequently, they are subject to punishment by jailing (removal from the validator set) and/or slashing (penalty in native tokens). Our emulations, under controlled conditions, demonstrate the same results, raising serious concerns about the potential for the geospatial centralization of validators. To address this, we developed a solution that easily integrates with consensus protocols, and we demonstrated its effectiveness.</p>

            <p><b>Abstract:</b> We will present modern algorithms, mainly based in Zero Knowledge Proofs, that allow for transparently proving liabilities. This set of interesting cryptographic primitives was originally explored as a method to prove financial solvency, but as we will show, they are directly applicable in domains outside finance, including transparent and private donations, voting, gambling, and publicly verifiable official reports, such as COVID-19 daily cases and unemployment rates. These applications share a common nature in incentives: it is not in prover's interest to increase the total liabilities. Finally, along with proposing solutions, a list of realistic blockers, considerations and outstanding vulnerable implementations will hopefully depict the full spectrum of what is possible today and what the community should learn from past mistakes.</p>

            <p><b>Abstract:</b> Any CBDC system, if and when deployed into production, is expected to be in production for a long period of time, on the scale of decades. As such, crypto-agility is foundational to the overall security posture and must be considered from a system design perspective. The advent of quantum computing and quantum-safe cryptographic primitives acts as a driver towards considering crypto-agility from a practical perspective. The system could be designed to either incorporate quantum-safe algorithms from inception or develop a path towards future integration of quantum-safe algorithms. In this work, the performance impact of various cryptographic algorithms and design choices on an operational CBDC model is explored, with a focus on the TLS exchange as a foundational block for establishing a secure channel between two entities. The memory consumption and latency of multiple implementations of key encapsulation mechanisms (KEMs) and signatures were benchmarked against the baseline of ECDH+ECDSA. Four distinct configurations were evaluated, namely typical desktop clients, consensus protocols, smartphones and resource-constrained IoT devices. Experimental results suggest that quantum-safe algorithms are competitive to classical algorithms under specific configurations, and could be considered for inclusion at the design stage. Certain limitations were observed in benchmarks with IoT devices, requiring future study as hardware evolves.</p>

            <p><b>Abstract:</b> Abstract. The arithmetic of computing multiple scalar multiplications in an elliptic curve group then adding them together is called multi-scalar multiplication (MSM). MSM over fixed points dominates the time consumption in the pairing-based trusted setup zero-knowledge succinct non-interactive argument of knowledge (zkSNARK), thus for practical applications we would appreciate fast algorithms to compute it. This paper proposes a bucket set construction that can be utilized in the context of Pippenger’s bucket method to speed up MSM over fixed points with the help of precomputation. If instantiating the proposed construction over BLS12-381 curve, when computing n-scalar multiplications for n = 2^e (10 ≤ e ≤ 21), theoretical analysis indicates that the proposed construction saves more than 21% computational cost compared to Pippenger’s bucket method, and that it saves 2.6% to 9.6% computational cost compared to the most popular variant of Pippenger’s bucket method. Finally, our experimental result demonstrates the feasibility of accelerating the computation of MSM over fixed points using large precomputation tables as well as the effectiveness of our new construction.</p>

            <p><b>Abstract:</b> An exchange between two parties is called "fair" when both parties receive what they agreed to or neither party gains anything. Fair exchange of digital goods over the internet has been shown to be impossible to achieve without the help of a trusted third party (TTP). Recent research FairSwap (Dziembowski et al.) and OptiSwap (Eckey et al.) consider an exchange between a Buyer who is willing to pay $p$ digital coins to a Seller in exchange for a digital item $x$. These works present protocols that achieve a fairness without a TTP by deploying a smart contract executed on a blockchain. Both protocols require the Buyer to reveal part of their purchase to the smart contract in order to complain about a Seller who tries to cheat. We observe that leaking part of the purchase in this way can motivate an honest party to forgo their fairness guarantee in order protect their sensitive information. We discuss the interplay between privacy and fairness. Then present privacy enhanced versions of FairSwap and OptiSwap that prevent this leakage using circuit randomization techniques first proposed to protect secrets in hardware circuits.</p>

            <p><b>Abstract:</b> Outsourcing computation enables a weak client to expand its computational power without requiring the need to plan and maintain local computing infrastructure. A basic requirement of outsourcing computation is to trust the result of the computation. We propose a system for delegation of computation to two cloud servers using a smart contract that guarantees correct computation results as long as at least one server is honest. This scheme follows from Refereed Delegation Computation (RDoC) framework of Canetti, Riva, and Rothblum that assumes a trusted client and uses two cloud servers, where one of the servers arbitrarily deviates from the protocol. Using a smart contract significantly relaxes trust assumption on the client and minimizes the client’s computation and interactions with the servers. However, direct use of RDoC in smart contract setting will be insecure because of copy attack where a server copies the result of the other server and will receive the reward without having done the work.  We propose systems with proved security that protect against this attack and show their extension to secure multi-server setting where only one out of n servers is honest. We also discuss our implementation and experiment results using Ethereum smart contracts.</p>

            <p> <b>Abstract: </b>Standardization is a useful tool that can help industry and government tackle a wide variety of problems. Standards and conformity assessments help foster collaboration, trade, and global connectivity, notably when they are developed by consensus and involve balanced stakeholder participation from industry, government, academia, and civil society. Several foundational standards have been published in the blockchain space, and others are in development, but there is much more work to be done. <br><br>In this talk, I will provide an overview of how the standardization system works, introduce some blockchain standards efforts, outline a roadmap for Canadian blockchain standards work, and share insights from stakeholders in the blockchain space to help address challenges and advance opportunities for Canada. </p>
                    <p><b>Bio:</b> Dominik Brejta is a Sector Specialist at the Standards Council of Canada (SCC).

            <p> <b>Abstract: </b>Supply chains can be very complex but are still very linear. The industry has been doing business the same way for centuries using physical paperwork to exchange goods between trading partners. Global supply chains are getting ever more complex and in some cases critical to national security. This is why blockchain technology, in conjunction with other technologies or on its own, can play an important role in reshaping today’s supply chains by breaking down traditional data silos. </p>
                    <p><b>Bio:</b> Erik is the co-founder and CEO of the Blockchain Supply Chain Association. Through their core services of Advocacy, Collaboration and Education, they bring together like-minded professionals who want to explore Blockchain in their supply chain. The member-driven association's goal is to accelerate the adoption of Distributed Ledger Technology through dialog, to help shape policy with governmental agencies for improved services, and to help the community's voice to be heard. <br><br>With a 30 year career in logistics, he’s passionate about bridging the gap between technology and business needs and is a firm believer that Blockchain has the potential to bring global supply chain management to the next level by reducing inefficiencies. Erik is based in Montreal, Canada. </p>

            <p> <b>Abstract: </b>Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) is fiat money in digital form. It is issued by the central bank or monetary authority of a country and is legal tender. It is not private money. The latest BIS survey indicates 90% of the world’s central banks and monetary authorities are at various stages of considering CBDCs. CBDC is quite literally the future of money. <br><br>The award-winning "Sand Dollar" issued by the Central Bank of the Bahamas is one of a small handful of live, full-scale CBDC productions in the world. It is also the most stable and most mature, having had a two-year head start. As such, it provides interesting insights and lessons regarding CBDCs and their deployment and use. As a Co-Founder of the company that helped create the Sand Dollar, I will provide a closer look behind the scenes into Sand Dollar and share some of our experiences working with a live CBDC deployment. </p>

<font color=#003366 size=+2><b>Call for Presentation</b></font>

<p>BTS provides a forum for the blockchain community to present their work to a diverse audience with  broad background and interests in blockchain 
    and distributed ledger technologies, including government, financial institutions and payment systems, industries,  and health and energy sectors,  
    academia,  research organizations, and  small businesses. Talks from all relevant disciplines are welcome. The presentations however  are expected 
    to be at a level that is accessible  to a large portion of attendees. </p>
    

<p>BTS does not have published proceedings. We invite talks on the latest research and development in relevant areas, including exploratory talks that 
    shed light on less understood aspects of blockchain, or provide insight on challenges of blockchain technologies.  Talks may be based on recently  
    published work at conferences or journals, or projects that are in-progress, as well as industry talks that discuss new applications and raise 
    questions.</p>

<p>We encourage connection to the Canadian context when possible.</p>

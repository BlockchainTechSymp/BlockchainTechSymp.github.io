            <p> <b>Abstract: </b>Over the past year, non-fungible tokens (NFTs) 
                        have leapt to prominence as a technical and social phenomenon. 
                        Popular tokens such as the Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) are 
                        attracting enormous sums of money and spawning whole subcultures. 
                        Current platforms for NFT distribution and management have 
                        endowed NFT marketplaces with attractive features and capabilities, 
                        but have unfortunate drawbacks. For example, in "drops" of 
                        popular NFTs today, it is hard to achieve fairness: Bots 
                        often snap up new offerings and corner the market. 
                        In this talk, I'll propose desirable security features and 
                        functionality for future NFT platforms, discuss resulting 
                        technical challenges, and outline some candidate solutions.  </p>

            <p> <b>Abstract: </b>Permissionless blockchains such as Bitcoin have 
                excelled at financial services. Yet, opportunistic traders extract 
                monetary value from the mesh of decentralized finance (DeFi) smart 
                contracts through so-called blockchain extractable value (BEV). 
                The recent emergence of centralized BEV relayer portrays BEV as a 
                positive additional revenue source. Because BEV, however, was quantitatively 
                shown to deteriorate the blockchain's consensus security, BEV relayers 
                endanger the ledger security by incentivizing rational miners to 
                fork the chain. For example, a rational miner with a 10% hashrate 
                will fork Ethereum if a BEV opportunity exceeds 4x the block reward. <br><br>
                
                In this talk, we quantify the BEV danger by deriving the USD extracted 
                from sandwich attacks, liquidations, and decentralized exchange arbitrage. 
                We estimate that over 32 months, BEV yielded 540.54M USD in profit, 
                divided among 11,289 addresses when capturing 49,691 cryptocurrencies 
                and 60,830 on-chain markets. The highest BEV instance we find amounts 
                to 4.1M USD, 616.6x the Ethereum block reward. Moreover, while the practitioner's 
                community has discussed the existence of generalized trading bots, 
                we are, to our knowledge, the first to provide a concrete algorithm. 
                Our algorithm can replace unconfirmed transactions without the need 
                to understand the victim transactions' underlying logic, which we 
                estimate to have yielded a profit of 57,037.32 ETH (35.37M USD) 
                over 32 months of past blockchain data. <br><br>

            <p> <b>Abstract: </b>Standardization is a useful tool that can help industry and government tackle a wide variety of problems. Standards and conformity assessments help foster collaboration, trade, and global connectivity, notably when they are developed by consensus and involve balanced stakeholder participation from industry, government, academia, and civil society. Several foundational standards have been published in the blockchain space, and others are in development, but there is much more work to be done.<br><br>
            
            In this talk, I will provide an overview of how the standardization system works, introduce some blockchain standards efforts, outline a roadmap for Canadian blockchain standards work, and share insights from stakeholders in the blockchain space to help address challenges and advance opportunities for Canada.</p>

            <p> <b>Abstract: </b>Cryptographers have been complaining that in the popular press and the media "Cryptocurrency" has been called "Crypto" while among cryptographers "Crypto" is a shorthand for "Cryptography." While there is an issue of overloading a shorthand term for more than a single notion, the goal of this talk is to claim that the controversy is not a serious issue.  In fact, while cryptocurrency development has suffered at times some cryptographic implementation issues and the area is evolving without the typical rigor of cryptography, cryptocurrency is in fact a subarea of cryptography (and distributed computing). The origin of bitcoin and blockchain is in cryptography and certainly no one refutes that the area is based on cryptography. Furthermore, cryptocurrency caused various interesting notions developed in cryptography to be useful and evolve into actual usage; and finally, cryptocurrencies and blockchain research also imply new cryptographic developments. Therefore, it is much more effective to endorse cryptocurrency as a legitimate, striving, and useful subarea of cryptography. It is much more effective for cryptographers to engage in cryptocurrency and blockchain research, then starting a mini "culture war" against the area! The talk will visit these issues. </p>

            <p> <b>Abstract: </b>Although practical Byzantine fault-tolerant (BFT) consensus protocols have 
                been available for two decades, they have never been deployed in production 
                until very recently. The widespread interest in cryptocurrencies and 
                blockchains has changed this. BFT consensus protocols are at the heart of 
                many current blockchain platforms, which run without a central authority. <br><br>
 
                This presentation will explore the foundations of BFT consensus, such as 
                quorum systems, reliable broadcasts, and protocols for storing data.  
                Furthermore, the talk also discusses protocols with asymmetric trust. By 
                letting nodes express their subjective assumptions of whom they trust and 
                by how much, this model bridges between standard BFT consensus and 
                decentralized blockchains. The approach is related to consensus in the 
                Ripple and Stellar blockchains, which have introduced similar ideas but 
                only with a heuristic approach. 
                
                
                
            <p><b>Bio:</b> Christian Cachin is a professor of computer science at the University of 
                Bern (Switzerland), where he has been leading the Cryptology and Data 
                Security Research Group since 2019. Prior to that he worked for IBM 
                Research - Zurich during more than 20 years. He has held visiting 
                positions at MIT and at EPFL and has taught at several universities during 
                his career in industrial research. He graduated with a Ph.D. in Computer 
                Science from ETH Zurich in 1997. He is an ACM Fellow, an IEEE Fellow, 
                recipient of multiple IBM Outstanding Technical Achievement Awards, and has 
                also served as the President of the International Association for 
                Cryptologic Research (IACR) from 2014-2019. <br><br>
 
                With a background in cryptography, he is interested in all aspects of 
                security in distributed systems and especially in cryptographic protocols, 
                consistency, consensus, blockchains, and cloud-computing security. He 
                has developed many cryptographic protocols, particularly for achieving 
                consensus and for executing distributed cryptographic operations over the 
                Internet. In the area of cloud computing, he has contributed to standards 
                in storage security and developed protocols for key management. He has

            <p> <b>Abstract: </b>It's widely appreciated by now that all cryptocurrencies and 
                        blockchains need some sort of confidentiality mechanism for their most 
                        interesting applications (whether that's sensitive financial data, 
                        supply chain records, healthcare data, etc.). We want the benefits 
                        associated with pool sensitive data and making use of a shared 
                        transaction platform, but without the vulnerability and trust required 
                        that this normally entails. <br><br>
                        
                        Smart contract developers know that they have at their disposal - at 
                        least in principle - an impressive toolbox of cryptography primitives, 
                        including zero knowledge proofs, multiparty computation, and hardware 
                        enclaves. However, it's still difficult to design and build systems 
                        based on these, in part because the software tooling is still so 
                        early. I'll explain a layered design framework that links these 
                        approaches together, and present a few recent research efforts that 
                        present a unified programming framework to offer developers. </p>

        <button class="collapsible-radius">Learn More</button>
        <div class="content1">
            <p> <b>Abstract: </b>Patients are offered an increasing number of methods 
                for collecting and managing healthcare information using digital 
                technologies. These digital methods generate tremendous opportunities 
                to monitor patient care but also perform research and monetize data. 
                To provide informed consent for health data uses outside of traditional 
                healthcare, patients are increasingly interested in dynamic consent: 
                the ability to manage consent and preferences over time. Organizations' 
                hesitations about offering dynamic consent included administrative 
                burdens and technological costs. Both of these burdens are alleviated 
                by capabilities offered by blockchain-based technologies. This presentation 
                presents emerging benefits, obstacles, and ethical principles about 
                blockchain-based dynamic consent methods. For the areas where digital 
                informed consent creates uncertainties, ethical, user-design, and 
                security recommendations will be provided. </p>

            <p> <b>Abstract: </b>Electronic retail payment mechanisms, especially e-commerce and card payments 
                at the point of sale, have increasingly replaced cash in many developed 
                countries.  As a result, societies are losing a critical public retail payment 
                option, and retail consumers are losing important rights associated with using 
                cash.  We offer a scalable architecture for electronic retail payments via 
                central bank digital currency and offer a solution to the perceived conflict 
                between robust regulatory oversight and consumer affordances such as privacy 
                and control.  Our architecture combines existing work in payment systems and 
                digital currency with a new approach to digital asset design for managing 
                unforgeable, stateful, and oblivious assets without relying on either a central 
                authority or a monolithic consensus system.  Regulated financial institutions 
                have a role in every transaction, and the consumer affordances are achieved 
                through the use of non-custodial wallets that unlink the sender from the 
                recipient in the transaction channel.  This approach is fully compatible with 
                the existing two-tiered banking system and can complement and extend the roles 
                of existing money services businesses and asset custodians.  We also show that 
                it is possible to introduce regulation of digital currency transactions 
                involving non-custodial wallets that unconditionally protect the privacy of 
                end-users.   </p>

            <p> <b>Abstract: </b>Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) is fiat money in digital form. It is issued by the central bank or monetary authority of a country and is legal tender. It is not private money. The latest BIS survey indicates 90% of the world’s central banks and monetary authorities are at various stages of considering CBDCs. CBDC is quite literally the future of money. <br><br>The award-winning "Sand Dollar" issued by the Central Bank of the Bahamas is one of a small handful of live, full-scale CBDC productions in the world. It is also the most stable and most mature, having had a two-year head start. As such, it provides interesting insights and lessons regarding CBDCs and their deployment and use. As a Co-Founder of the company that helped create the Sand Dollar, I will provide a closer look behind the scenes into Sand Dollar and share some of our experiences working with a live CBDC deployment. </p>
